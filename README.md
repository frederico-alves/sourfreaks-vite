    -- Check out (a report of the products that you bought)
    -- Explain how your code works (use a video recording for the explanation)
    -- Define criteria for evaluating React, then use the criteria to make a weighted comparison matrix for your evaluation. And answer the below questions (taken from “Reflective writing”):
        - What broad lessons did you learn?
        - What was the most fulfilling part of your experience? And the least fulfilling part of it? What does this suggest to you about your values?
        - What happened that contradicted your prior beliefs?
        - How did your thinking develop and what were the effects of this on your project?
        - How have your assumptions about practice changed?
        - What were the consequences of unexpected or difficult feelings?
